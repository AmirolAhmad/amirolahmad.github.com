    <h1>Crap. I really couldn't find that page.</h1>
    <p>Dude, whatever page you're looking for is not here. You're going to have to come to terms with that. There's a solid chance you can find the correct link <a href="/">on this page</a>, though. Go check it out. I'll wait.</p>
    <p>Christ, you're taking forever. Go find the damn thing already, okay? I'm done waiting. I'm going to go get some gin and drink away this embarrassing situation from my memory.</p>
    <p>The good news is that I found the gin, but I had to set fire to a small Irishman to get it. I don't know why the Irishman had the gin — it seems culturally inappropriate — but he did and now it is getting drunked by me. IF ONLY YOU HAD FOUND THE RIGHT LINK HOURS AGO THIS WOULND'T HAVE HAPPEND.</p>
    <p>Hearts and kisses,</p>
    <p>Carlos Alexandro Becker</p>
