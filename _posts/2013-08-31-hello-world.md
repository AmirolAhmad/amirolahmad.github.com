Hello everyone :)

I just started a new blog where I am going to rant about all the latest technologies, programming methods and also share some
awesome snippets for better productivity.

I always hated Wordpres because I think it is heavy and slow. So, I decided to give a [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) a try.

I will not go through on "*how to setup jekyll*", as you can read it [here](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

It's dead simple to configure, deploying, writing posts, pages, and modifications can easily seen in my local server :)
And on top of that, it's freaking fast.

In short: Jekyll is great, and I realy like it!

In the coming weeks, I'll posts tutorials on how to hack and automate your house and car with [RaspberryPi](http://raspberrypi.org) and some addons. I'll also write on setting up your ideal networking enviroment, pentesting enviroment and also development workspace.
