> *Sublime Text 2/3 - A tool any developer will fall in love with!*

Being a developer for almost 6 years, I've tried almost all kinds of text editors from [Notepad++][N++] to powerful IDE such as the [Visual Studio][VS] and finally resorted to [Vim][Vim].

**Recently however, I made a switch and trust me, it has been the best decision so far at least programming-wise. :P** 

Being a programmer proficient with many languages, Vim however wasn't good enough and me getting involved in a new project beased on Ruby on Rails called [Instajob][IJ] required me to work with many other things together.

[Github][GH] with [Git][Git], [Heroku][Heroku], and also developing on [Ruby on Rails][Rails] required me to use something far more flexible. So, I ditched Vim; *the editor you need to read two books atleast* and finally made way for [Sublime Text 2][ST2].

Sublime Text 2, here on known as ST was my choice of editor since I'm running on Linux and ST3 wasn't stable yet. However, this post will not cover the installation part but you can find out how to install ST on [Linux][], [Mac][] and [Windows][].
